# CatGPT
*What if ChatGPT were a cat?*

ChatGPT is boring. I want a cat to answer my questions. So I built CatGPT!

## How?
The latest in pawtifurcial intelligence, CatGPT uses a purr-al network and an advanced hairballgorithm to come up with natural-sounding responses.

Not really though, it just returns random meows. 

## Why?
I made this site for fun, and to try out programming with ChatGPT.
To be clear: this site does not actually use ChatGPT or any other form of AI. Nothing is done with the user input either.

I did use ChatGPT to help build it. My first question was *'Create a website with HTML and CSS, that looks like ChatGPT'*. It took some back and forth to get something looking alright, but it was quite useful to create a basic structure for the web page.

When the site got more complicated though, any new changes I requested would break the site, or revert previous changes.

I also let ChatGPT generate the first version of the JavaScript code, but needed to tweak that by hand too.

In summary, the ChatGPT use case I see is to get a quick basic structure as a starting point for building a site.  But AI is not good at getting the site to do creative things.

### Some credits
The airplane icon is from FontAwesome, the user avatar is from Iconsax. The site lives on Netlify, I use Counter.dev to get some statistics.

The cat in the image is called Suus.
